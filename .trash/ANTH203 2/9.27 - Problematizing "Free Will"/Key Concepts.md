- [[will]] - use and “abuse” of drugs/alcohol have historically been attributed to “weak will”
	- addiction was moralized - was made a moral issue - people who are dependent on substances are morally weak (weak will)
- [[addiction]] - judged and determined by socio-historical factors and social stereotypes
