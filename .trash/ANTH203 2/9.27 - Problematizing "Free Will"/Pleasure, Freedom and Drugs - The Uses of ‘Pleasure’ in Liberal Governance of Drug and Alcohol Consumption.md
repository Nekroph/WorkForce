	- pleasure is a function of willpower and personal choice and connected to rationality and moral responsibility
- substance/alcohol use becomes a moral issue that comes with negative connotations
	- goal is to discourage use
- pleasure
	- even when pleasure is advertised as a reason for consumption, it is mitigated by moral imperatives, such as admonishments to “enjoy responsibly”
	- pleasure and rationality are linked (neoliberal freedom?)
	- that freedom becomes problematic when the priority of pleasure exceeds the responsibility one has as a governed citizen
- moralizing pleasure
	- moral
		- moderation is associated with positive societal outcomes and economic productivity

	- lack of moderation is associated with negative societal outcomes and economic irresponsibility
	- excessive consumption is morally deplorable and characteristic of savage behaviour and tendencies
- excessive pleasure as a loss of freedom
	- having the ability to control ones taste for pleasure in the form of substances signaled an exercise of feel will/moderation
	- excessive use of substances signalled as a lack of free will/irrational
	- consumer market terms such as “use”, “abuse”, and “consumption” imply that there is always a choice when it comes to substance use
		- our society dictates which choice is the **morally correct one**
- addiction & pleasure
	- pleasure and addiction are functions of each other (according to the neoliberal model)
	- the more addicted/dependent one becomes, the less “pleasure” there is, compared to the temporary relief of displeasure (withdrawal symptoms)
	- at a certain point, does addiction remove the possibility for pleasure?
	- drug education/awareness materials often call addictive use “compulsive”
	- users are seen as having no choice, and pleasure is never considered
- harm reduction strategies
	- reduce all drug use into a functional category
	- educate the public
