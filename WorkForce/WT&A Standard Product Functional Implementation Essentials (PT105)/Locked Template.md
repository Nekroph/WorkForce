[[Template|Templates]] inside the templates framework are used to apply [[extension|extensions]] to the client's settings. The vast majority of [[extension|extensions]] are imported as locked templates. The templates framework enables you to interact with templates by utilizing specifically built user interfaces within the Policy Editor that make it simple to import and manage templates.

The [[WTA Templates Framework]] Guide contains information on dealing with templates, parameters, and extra resources related to templates. The Partner Community has this version-specific guide.

### Modifying Locked Templates

When a locked template closely matches the demands of a customer, you may wish to save time configuring by altering the locked template.

Unlocked templates' parameters can be modified, but locked templates' parameters are read-only. Changing the choices specified in the [[Standard Product]] is considered customization, not using the Template Details box to edit the parameters of restricted [[template|templates]].

Locked templates can be unlocked if a modification to the template is required that is not permitted by the template's parameters. When you unlock a template, you may alter all of its policies and information rows in the [[Policy Editor]]. The [[template]]'s behavior may only be changed by editing the individual policies and detail rows that form it.

*It's critical to remember that unlocking a locked [[template]] removes the ability to update it in the future. If the underlying regulations change, [[template|templates]] can be upgraded.*
