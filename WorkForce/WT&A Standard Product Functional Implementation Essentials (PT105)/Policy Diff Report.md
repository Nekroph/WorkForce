The HTML-based Policy Diff Report created during policy migration shows how the configuration of the destination environment will change as a result of the migration. The differences (additions, deletions, and revisions) for each of the impacted policies and policy sets are listed in the report.

### Body Of the Report

The policy records and sets are listed in the order they occur in the policy tree inside each section. All policy records and sets, including those that were not chosen for migration, are presented for your convenience.
