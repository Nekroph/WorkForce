This procedure is identical to the guidelines for the [[WorkForce/WT&A Standard Product Functional Implementation Essentials (PT105)/Setup A US Market Instance|US Market]] instructions, except you will not need the US Wage, Hour, and Holiday [[template]]. You may also use this procedure to create a simple US Market]] without the rules. 

The Document Directory contains links to all of the documentation mentioned.

### Step 1: Environments Created

*WorkForce Cloud Services creates DEV, TEST, PROD, and any other appropriate environments upon execution of a SaaS agreement. To check on the status of this initial stage, project teams can file a ticket. 

Log in to the [Partner Community](https://workforcesoftware.force.com/customers) to file a ticket. 

The construction begins with the most recent [[Global Base Dataset]]. Even yet, if there is a delay between environment formation and configuration start, you will reload this in a subsequent stage. 
*Consultants should discuss which environment to work in with their Project Manager or Configuration Lead.*

### Step 2: Gather Documentation

Make sure you have the following documentation available before starting configuration: 


1. **Customer Standard Product Setup Questionnaire**
2. **GLOBAL_BASE Template Instructions** 
3. **STANDARD_PRODUCT Template Instructions**
4. **WT&A US Base Product Creating Environment with** Data
5. **WT&A Base Product Demonstration Guide**

The client answering the setup questionnaire is one of the initial steps in the implementation process. This might happen as early as the sales cycle. 

The [[Standard Product]] cannot be created without the questionnaire.

### Step 3: Reload the [[Global Base Dataset]]

The [[Global Base Dataset]] serves as the starting point for all configurations. When WorkForce Cloud Services creates an environment, it comes pre-loaded with this foundation dataset. Nonetheless, as your initial configuration step, you will reload this. This is in case there is a delay between the establishment of the environment and the start of the setup. 

Submit a ticket with the request in the [Partner Community](https://workforcesoftware.force.com/customers) to acquire access to the customer's environments.
