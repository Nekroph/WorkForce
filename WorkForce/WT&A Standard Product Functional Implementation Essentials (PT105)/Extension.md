Synonymous with [[Model]].

Implemented using individual [[Model|Models]] and the related [[template|templates]]. extensions are added on top the same way for all [[market|markets]].

Extensions are shopped by the customer and chosen.  They could be [[model]]-only or [[model]]+[[template]].  While many are generic, they may also choose a market-specific [[model]] to use in a different [[market]] because the functionality aligned with their needs.
