Policies such as [[Pay Code]] policies, sometimes known as *auto-stitching*, can be reused between templates. If a template import identifies an existing policy that is also in the template to be imported, the existing policy will be used by the template. The old policy will subsequently be transformed into a common policy. The WTA Templates Framework Guide includes particular considerations for shared policies.
