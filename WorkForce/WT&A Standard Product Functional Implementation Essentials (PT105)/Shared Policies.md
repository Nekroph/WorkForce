Policies such as [[Pay Code]] policies, sometimes known as *auto-stitching*, it can be reused between [[Template|templates]]. If a [[Template|template]] import identifies an existing policy that is also in the [[Template|template]] to be imported, the existing policy will be used by the [[Template|template]]. The old policy will subsequently be transformed into a common policy. The WTA Templates Framework Guide includes particular considerations for shared policies.
