### Step 1: Environments Created

Each customer must complete this step once. *WorkForce Cloud Services creates DEV, TEST, PROD, and any other appropriate environments upon execution of a SaaS agreement. To learn more about the progress of this first stage, project teams can file a ticket.

The most recent [[Global Base Dataset]] is used to begin the construction. Even so, in case there is a release between creating the environment and starting the configuration, you will reload this in the step that follows. 

When deciding which environment to work in, consultants should consult their project manager or configuration lead.

### Step 2: Gather Documentation

Make sure you have the following documentation available before starting configuration: 


**1. Customer US Product Setup Questionnaire**
**2. GLOBAL_BASE Template Instructions**
**3. STANDARD_PRODUCT Template Instructions**
**4. US_WAGE_HOUR_AND_HOL Template Instructions**
**5. WT&A US Base Product Creating Environment with Data**
**6. WT&A Base Product Demonstration Guide**
**7. (Optional) Additional Policy Profile Questionnaires**

The client filling out the setup questionnaire is one of the initial steps in the implementation process. This might even be finished before the sales cycle. 

The setup of the US [[Standard Product]] is not possible without the questionnaire.

### Step 3: Reload the [[Global Base Dataset]]

The [[Global Base Dataset]] serves as the starting point for all configurations. When WorkForce Cloud Services creates an environment, it comes pre-loaded with this foundation dataset. Nonetheless, as your initial configuration step, you will reload this. This is in case there is a delay between the establishment of the environment and the start of the setup. 

Submit a ticket with the request in the [Partner Community](https://workforcesoftware.force.com/customers) to acquire access to the customer's environments.
