These instructions will lead you through the process of creating a new configuration for a non-defined Market using the Ad-Hoc Product. Any examples offered here are for illustration purposes only, and the same methods can be applied to any specified Market. To recap, an [[Undefined Market]] differs from a [[Defined Market]] in that the buyer must first shop the models to choose the ones that best suit their company needs before beginning a construction. 

This approach takes longer than [[Setup Non-US Market Instance|setting up a Non-US Market Instance]] but it delivers specialized [[Market]] capabilities rather than broad capability. 

All mentioned documentation may be located in the Document Directory or Knowledge Base.

### Step 1: Environments Created

*WorkForce Cloud Services creates DEV, TEST, PROD, and any other appropriate environments upon execution of a SaaS agreement. To check on the status of this initial stage, project teams can file a ticket. 

Log in to the [Partner Community](https://workforcesoftware.force.com/customers) to file a ticket. 

The construction begins with the most recent [[Global Base Dataset]]. Even yet, if there is a delay between environment formation and configuration start, you will reload this in a subsequent stage. 

*Consultants should discuss which environment to work in with their Project Manager or Configuration Lead.*

### Step 2: Gather Documentation

Ensure you have the following documentation available and ready:

1. **Ad-Hoc Selection of Models for WT&A**
2. **Standard Product Assembly Instructions for Ad-Hoc Product**
3. **Model-Template Mapping**
4. **GLOBAL_BASE Template Instructions** 
5. **GEN_CONTAINER Template Instructions**
6. **Model-Template Mapping**

The [[Ad-Hoc Product]], unlike the [[Defined Market|Defined Markets]], does not have a standard questionnaire. Customers shop the models by making the selections specified in the Ad-Hoc Selection of Models for WT&A document. It is critical that you have a complete list of shopped models for the consumer. 

You must also use the Options sections of the MFDs that the client has chosen, which is a variable list for each implementation. Based on their model decisions, they would have to aggregate the alternatives to specify.
