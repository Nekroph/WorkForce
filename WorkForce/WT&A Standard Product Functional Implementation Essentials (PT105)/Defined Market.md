A Defined Market has been pre-shopped for particular models to meet the needs of that [[Market]]. 

Uses a combination of [[Market-Specific Template|Market-Specific]] and [[Generic Template|Generic Templates]].

Markets of other countries have been defined with their own sets of documentation, [[Model|Models]] and [[Template|Templates]]. The starting point for each Defined Market is the [[Global Base Dataset]], [[Global Base Template]], and then the [[WorkForce/WT&A Standard Product Functional Implementation Essentials (PT105)/Generic Container]] layer. Once these are in place, [[Model|Models]] can begin being added for that [[Market]].
