You can develop marketplaces in the necessary sequence thanks to the [[Standard Product]]'s flexibility. This implies that the client, [[Market]], or implementation approach are all considerations in the remaining construction sequence once the Environment and Base Policies have been built. If a customer wants you to, you can either develop one market with extensions and then add markets, or you may build all of their basic markets first and add extensions afterwards.
