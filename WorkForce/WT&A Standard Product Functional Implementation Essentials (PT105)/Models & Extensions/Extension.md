Synonymous with [[Model]].

Implemented using individual [[Model|Models]] and the related [[Template|templates]]. extensions are added on top the same way for all [[Market|markets]].

Extensions are shopped by the customer and chosen.  They could be [[Model]]-only or [[Model]]+[[Template]].  While many are generic, they may also choose a market-specific [[Model]] to use in a different [[Market]] because the functionality aligned with their needs.
