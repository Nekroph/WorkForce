These [[Market|Markets]] are quickly set up because they have the [[Standard Product]] Templates. If the customer has multiple businesses within the US that vary on [[Policy Profiles]], you can import the [[Standard Product]] Templates multiple times to build each of those together.

These steps will lead you through the process of creating a new setup with a predefined [[Market]]. The examples in this section are for Mexico, however the same methods may be applied to any designated Market. As a reminder, a [[Defined Market]] is one that has been pre-shopped for particular models to meet the needs of that [[Market]]. 

This approach takes longer than [[Setup Non-US Market Instance|setting up a Non-US Market]], but it delivers specialized [[Market]] capabilities rather than broad capability.

### Step 1: Environments Created

*WorkForce Cloud Services creates DEV, TEST, PROD, and any other appropriate environments upon execution of a SaaS agreement. To check on the status of this initial stage, project teams can file a ticket. 

Log in to the [Partner Community](https://workforcesoftware.force.com/customers) to file a ticket. 

The construction begins with the most recent [[Global Base Dataset]]. Even yet, if there is a delay between environment formation and configuration start, you will reload this in a subsequent stage. 

*Consultants should discuss which environment to work in with their Project Manager or Configuration Lead.*

### Step 2: Gather Documentation

Make sure you have the following documentation available before starting configuration: 


1. **MARKET - Customer Product Setup Questionnaire**
2. **MARKET Product Assembly Instructions**
3. **GLOBAL_BASE Template Instructions** 
4. **WT&A US Base Product Creating Environment with Data**
5. **WT&A Base Product Demonstration Guide**

The client answering the setup questionnaire is one of the initial steps in the implementation process. This might happen as early as the sales cycle. 

The [[Standard Product]] cannot be created without the questionnaire.
