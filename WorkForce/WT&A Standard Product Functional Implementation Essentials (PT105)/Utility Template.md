Unlocked [[template|templates]] that are used to quickly implement elements of custom setups are known as utility templates. They do not have [[Model|Models]] for preset functionality outputs for end users, unlike [[extension|extensions]].


While the Models are normally shopped by the client, a more extensive requirements gathering procedure is required to understand the customer's business needs. The collected criteria will then be matched to the available list of templates. Because they are unlocked, changes may be made to get the desired results.
